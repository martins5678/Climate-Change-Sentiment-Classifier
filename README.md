## Introduction

A climate-based products vendor seeks to gauge public perception of climate change to refine market research efforts and gain insights into consumer sentiment. To address this, we developed and deployed a machine-learning model capable of predicting individuals' beliefs on climate change based on their tweets. The model classifies tweets into four categories: Pro (supporting man-made climate change), Anti (opposing man-made climate change), Neutral (neither supporting nor opposing), and News (providing factual information about climate change).


## Goal of the Project

> We aim to build and deploy a classification machine learning project capable of categorizing tweets into Pro, Anti, Neutral, or News. This classification enables our client to comprehend public sentiments on climate change, facilitating informed decision-making aligned with their target audience.

## Task Overview (My contribution)

Here is a high-level overview of my contributions:
* Removing URLs, numbers, and special characters to enhance text cleanliness.
* Standardizing text to lowercase for consistency.
* Stemming: Reducing words to their root form for uniformity.
* Removing stopwords: Eliminating common words with little meaning.
* Tokenization: Breaking text into words or sub-word units.
* Utilizing data visualization to identify patterns.
* Vectorization: Converting text data into numerical representations suitable for machine learning models.
* Feature selection for model training.
* Training classification models using machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, linear SVC, and multinomial Naive Bayes.
* Model evaluation: Assessing model performance using the Mean F1-Score.
* Model deployment of the machine learning app: Deploying the application using Streamlit and AWS EC2 instance.
